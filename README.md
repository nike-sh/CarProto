Conclusion
To summarise we started and ended with a clear game in mind, despite running into shortcomings we managed to finish the project. There are many features which could have been improved, however there are also satisfying features that are represented within the game. Within the timeframe we were given, the game that we have made was an accurate representation of what we envisioned and due to this time constraint we managed to miss out on some greater opportunities. Overall weâ€™re pleased with the end product and would call it a success.
